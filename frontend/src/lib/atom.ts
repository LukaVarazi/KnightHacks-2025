Dear Client,

Thank you for providing the initial details regarding your car accident. We have begun organizing the information, and to ensure we can proceed effectively, we require some additional details.

Defendant Information: We need the name and contact information of the other driver involved in the accident, or their relationship to you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Your Legal Team
